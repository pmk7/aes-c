AES-C
This project is an implementation of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) in C. AES is a symmetric block cipher that's used to encrypt and decrypt information in blocks of 128 bits.

Features
Implements AES encryption and decryption
Includes a main program that demonstrates encryption and decryption of a 128-bit block of plaintext using a 128-bit key

To compile the project, run:

`make`

To run tests, run:

`make test`
